# Setup (If using parallel worktrees)
1. Use 3 parallel processes (worktrees created from main branch)
   - Backend worktree (sync to backend branch)
   - Web worktree - React (sync to web branch)
   - App worktree - Flutter for iOS and Android (sync to the app branch)
2. Branch setup
   - Staging branch
   - Production branch (protected)
3. Review and update/create detailed implementation and integration plans

# From plans to todos
1. Referencing your plans in `workspaces/<project-directory>/02-plans`, ensure you work through every single file
   - (backend) Work with the agents in `.claude/agents` 
      - especially the framework specialists: kailash, kaizen, dataflow, nexus
      - follow our procedural directives
      - review and revise the plans as required
   - (frontend) Work with the agents in `.claude/agents/frontend`
      - review your implementation plans and todos for the frontends.
      - use a consistent set of design principles for all our FE interfaces.
      - use the latest modern UI/UX principles/components/widgets in your implementation.
2. This is where the codebases should reside
   - `src/...` for all backend codebase
   - `apps/web` for all web FE codebase
   - `apps/mobile` for all mobile FE codebase
3. Work with todo-manager, following our procedural directives
   - create detailed todos for EVERY todo/task required.
   - The detailed todos should be created in `todos/active`.
   - Review with red team agents continuously until they are satisfied that there are no gaps remaining.
4. Do not continue until I have approved your todos.
