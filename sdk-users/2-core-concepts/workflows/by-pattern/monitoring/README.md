# Monitoring Workflows

This directory contains comprehensive monitoring and health check workflow patterns using the Kailash SDK.

## Overview

Monitoring workflows provide real-time health checks, system monitoring, and alerting capabilities for enterprise infrastructure. These patterns use real endpoints and services rather than simulated data, making them production-ready for immediate deployment.

## Core Pattern: Health Check Monitoring

The health check monitor workflow demonstrates how to:
- **Monitor real services** using HTTPRequestNode against actual endpoints
- **Check multiple service types** (HTTP, database, file system)
- **Generate alerts** based on configurable thresholds
- **Create comprehensive reports** with health scores and recommendations

### Key Features

✅ **Real Service Monitoring** - Monitors actual HTTP endpoints and services
✅ **Docker Integration** - Works with Docker Compose infrastructure
✅ **Multi-Check Types** - HTTP, database, file system, and custom checks
✅ **Alerting Logic** - Configurable thresholds and notification rules
✅ **Comprehensive Reporting** - Health scores, trends, and recommendations

## Available Scripts

### `scripts/health_check_monitor.py`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive multi-service health monitoring system

**What it does**:
1. Monitors HTTP endpoints (APIs, web services, health checks)
2. Performs database connectivity checks via HTTP health endpoints
3. Monitors file system health and disk usage
4. Generates alerts based on configurable rules
5. Creates comprehensive health dashboard and reports

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run with Docker services
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.sdk-dev.yml up -d

# Run the health monitor
python sdk-users/workflows/by-pattern/monitoring/scripts/health_check_monitor.py

# The script will:
# - Check all configured service endpoints
# - Test database connectivity
# - Monitor system resources
# - Generate health report in /data/outputs/monitoring/
```

**Monitored Services**:
- HTTP health endpoints (JSONPlaceholder API, GitHub API)
- Docker PostgreSQL database (via health check endpoint)
- Docker MongoDB service (via health check endpoint)
- Local file system and disk usage

**Output**:
- Individual service health status
- Overall system health score
- Alert notifications for failing services
- Comprehensive monitoring report with recommendations

## Node Usage Patterns

### HTTP Health Checks
```python
# Monitor HTTP API endpoints
api_health_check = HTTPRequestNode(
    name="api_health_check",
    method="GET",
    url="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1",
    timeout=10.0
)

# Monitor service health endpoints
service_health_check = HTTPRequestNode(
    name="service_health_check",
    method="GET",
    url="http://localhost:8080/health",
    expected_status=200
)

```

### Database Connectivity Monitoring
```python
# Check database health via HTTP endpoint
db_health_check = HTTPRequestNode(
    name="database_health",
    method="GET",
    url="http://localhost:5432/health",  # PostgreSQL health check
    timeout=5.0
)

```

### Alert Integration with Discord
```python
# SDK Setup for example
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder
from kailash.runtime.local import LocalRuntime
from kailash.nodes.data import CSVReaderNode
from kailash.nodes.ai import LLMAgentNode
from kailash.nodes.api import HTTPRequestNode
from kailash.nodes.logic import SwitchNode, MergeNode
from kailash.nodes.code import PythonCodeNode
from kailash.nodes.base import Node, NodeParameter

# Example setup
workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
# Runtime should be created separately
runtime = LocalRuntime()

# Real-time Discord alerts for critical issues
critical_alert = DiscordAlertNode(
    name="critical_alert",
    webhook_url="${DISCORD_WEBHOOK}",
    alert_type="critical",
    title="🚨 Critical Service Failure",
    mentions=["@everyone"]
)

# System health dashboard updates
health_dashboard = DiscordAlertNode(
    name="health_dashboard",
    webhook_url="${DISCORD_WEBHOOK}",
    alert_type="info",
    title="📊 System Health Report",
    username="Health Monitor",
    footer_text="Updated every 5 minutes"
)

```

### Results Analysis and Alerting
```python
# SDK Setup for example
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder
from kailash.runtime.local import LocalRuntime
from kailash.nodes.data import CSVReaderNode
from kailash.nodes.ai import LLMAgentNode
from kailash.nodes.api import HTTPRequestNode
from kailash.nodes.logic import SwitchNode, MergeNode
from kailash.nodes.code import PythonCodeNode
from kailash.nodes.base import Node, NodeParameter

# Example setup
workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
# Runtime should be created separately
runtime = LocalRuntime()

# Analyze health check results and generate alerts
health_analyzer = PythonCodeNode.from_function(
    func=analyze_health_results,
    name="health_analyzer"
)

# Generate monitoring report
report_generator = PythonCodeNode.from_function(
    func=generate_monitoring_report,
    name="report_generator"
)

```

## Monitoring Strategies

### Service Health Monitoring
```python
def check_service_health(response_data):
    """Analyze HTTP response for service health"""
    if response_data.get("status_code") == 200:
        response_time = response_data.get("response_time", 0)
        if response_time < 1.0:  # Fast response
            return {"status": "healthy", "score": 100}
        elif response_time < 5.0:  # Acceptable response
            return {"status": "warning", "score": 75}
        else:  # Slow response
            return {"status": "critical", "score": 25}
    else:
        return {"status": "down", "score": 0}

```

### Alert Generation
```python
def generate_alerts(health_results):
    """Generate alerts based on health check results"""
    alerts = []
    for service, result in health_results.items():
        if result["score"] < 50:
            alerts.append({
                "service": service,
                "severity": "critical" if result["score"] == 0 else "warning",
                "message": f"Service {service} health score: {result['score']}"
            })
    return alerts

```

    "api_services": [
        {"name": "JSONPlaceholder", "url": "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"},
        {"name": "GitHub API", "url": "https://api.github.com/zen"}
    ],
    "databases": [
        {"name": "PostgreSQL", "url": "http://localhost:5432/health"},
        {"name": "MongoDB", "url": "http://localhost:27017/health"}
    ],
    "internal_services": [
        {"name": "Mock API", "url": "http://localhost:8888/health"}
    ]
}

```

### Alert Thresholds
```python
ALERT_THRESHOLDS = {
    "response_time": {
        "warning": 2.0,   # seconds
        "critical": 5.0   # seconds
    },
    "health_score": {
        "warning": 75,    # percentage
        "critical": 50    # percentage
    },
    "availability": {
        "warning": 95,    # percentage
        "critical": 90    # percentage
    }
}

```

## Best Practices

### Monitoring Frequency
- **Critical Services**: Every 30 seconds
- **Important Services**: Every 1-2 minutes
- **Supporting Services**: Every 5 minutes
- **Background Services**: Every 15 minutes

### Error Handling
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Set appropriate timeouts for different service types

## Advanced Patterns

### Cascading Health Checks
```python
# SDK Setup for example
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder
from kailash.runtime.local import LocalRuntime
from kailash.nodes.data import CSVReaderNode
from kailash.nodes.ai import LLMAgentNode
from kailash.nodes.api import HTTPRequestNode
from kailash.nodes.logic import SwitchNode, MergeNode
from kailash.nodes.code import PythonCodeNode
from kailash.nodes.base import Node, NodeParameter

# Example setup
workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
# Runtime should be created separately
runtime = LocalRuntime()

# Check dependent services in sequence
workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
workflow.add_connection("database_check", "result", "api_check", "input")  # API depends on DB
workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
workflow.add_connection("api_check", "result", "frontend_check", "input")  # Frontend depends on API

```

### Conditional Alerting
```python
# Only alert if multiple consecutive checks fail
alert_filter = SwitchNode(
    name="alert_filter",
    condition_# mapping removed,
        "continue_monitoring": "consecutive_failures < 3"
    }
)

```

### Health Score Aggregation
```python
# SDK Setup for example
from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder

from kailash.nodes.data import CSVReaderNode
from kailash.nodes.ai import LLMAgentNode
from kailash.nodes.api import HTTPRequestNode
from kailash.nodes.logic import SwitchNode, MergeNode
from kailash.nodes.code import PythonCodeNode
from kailash.nodes.base import Node, NodeParameter

# Example setup
workflow = WorkflowBuilder()
# Runtime should be created separately
runtime = LocalRuntime()

# Calculate overall system health from individual service scores
health_aggregator = PythonCodeNode.from_function(
    func=calculate_system_health,
    name="health_aggregator"
)

```
