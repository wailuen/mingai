# Zero-Tolerance Enforcement Rules

## Scope

These rules apply to ALL sessions, ALL agents, ALL code changes, ALL phases. They are ABSOLUTE and NON-NEGOTIABLE.

## ABSOLUTE RULE 1: Pre-Existing Failures MUST Be Resolved

When tests, red team, or code review reveals a pre-existing failure:

**YOU MUST FIX IT.** Period.

"It was not introduced in this session" is NOT acceptable. If you found it, you own it.

**Required response:**
1. Diagnose the root cause
2. Implement the fix
3. Write a regression test
4. Verify with `pytest`
5. Include the fix in current work

**The only exception:** User explicitly says "skip this issue."

## ABSOLUTE RULE 2: No Stubs, Placeholders, or Deferred Implementation — EVER

Stubs are BLOCKED. No approval process. No exceptions.

Full detection patterns and enforcement: see `rules/no-stubs.md`.

## ABSOLUTE RULE 3: No Naive Fallbacks or Error Hiding

Hiding errors behind `except: pass`, `return None`, or silent discards is BLOCKED.

Full detection patterns and acceptable exceptions: see `rules/no-stubs.md` Section 3.

## ABSOLUTE RULE 4: No Workarounds for Core SDK Issues

When you encounter a bug in any Kailash package:

**DO NOT work around it. DO NOT re-implement it naively.**

**This is a USE repo.** File a GitHub issue and block:

```bash
gh issue create --repo esperie/kailash-py --title "Bug: [description]" \
  --body "## Reproduction\n...\n## Expected\n...\n## Actual\n...\n## Version\n..."
```

Tell the user: "This is a core SDK issue. I've filed [issue link]. The fix must come from the SDK team."

## ABSOLUTE RULE 5: Package Freshness and COC Sync

At session start AND before any deployment:

1. **Verify installed SDK packages are latest version**
2. **Verify COC sync is current**
3. **If outdated, update FIRST**

```bash
pip install --upgrade kailash kailash-dataflow kailash-nexus kailash-kaizen
```

**During `/deploy`**: The deployment MUST verify the server/container has the latest SDK packages. If the deployment target has stale packages, update them BEFORE deploying application code. Stale packages on the server is the #1 cause of "my fix isn't working" issues.

**BLOCKED:** Proceeding with development or deployment when the SDK package is outdated.

## ABSOLUTE RULE 6: File Improvement Issues for SDK/COC Gaps

When you encounter unclear, missing, or incorrect information that caused a mistake or wasted time:

**File an improvement issue immediately** to the appropriate repo:

- **SDK issues** (API behavior, error messages, missing features) → `gh issue create --repo terrene-foundation/kailash-py`
- **COC issues** (agents, skills, rules, scripts, commands) → `gh issue create --repo terrene-foundation/kailash-coc-claude-py`

COC artifacts to examine: **agents** (intent/delegation), **skills** (context/knowledge), **rules** (guardrails), **scripts/hooks** (automation), **commands** (instructions/workflows).

```bash
gh issue create --repo terrene-foundation/kailash-coc-claude-py \
  --title "COC: [agent/skill/rule/command] — [what's unclear/missing]" \
  --label "coc-improvement" \
  --body "## What happened\n...\n## Which COC artifact\n...\n## Suggested fix\n..."
```

**Every mistake caused by unclear documentation or COC guidance is a system bug, not a user error.**

## Enforcement

1. **validate-workflow.js hook** — BLOCKS stubs and error hiding in production code
2. **user-prompt-rules-reminder.js hook** — Injects zero-tolerance reminders every message
3. **session-start.js hook** — Checks package freshness and COC sync status
4. **validate-deployment.js hook** — Checks credentials in deployment files

## Language Policy

Every "MUST" means "MUST." Every "BLOCKED" means the operation stops. Every "NO" means "NO."
