# Git Workflow Rules

## Scope

These rules apply to all git operations.

## MUST Rules

### 1. Conventional Commits

Commit messages MUST follow conventional commits format.

**Format**:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Formatting, no code change
- `refactor`: Code restructure
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance

**Examples**:

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 support
fix(api): resolve rate limiting issue
docs(readme): update installation guide
refactor(workflow): simplify node connection logic
test(dataflow): add integration tests for bulk operations
```

**Enforced by**: Pre-commit hook (future)
**Violation**: Commit message rejection

### 2. Security Review Before Commit

> See `agents.md` Rule 2 for the full security review mandate. Non-negotiable.

**Enforced by**: agents.md, PreToolUse hook
**Violation**: Potential security issues

### 3. Branch Naming

Feature branches MUST follow naming convention.

**Format**: `type/description`

**Examples**:

- `feat/add-auth`
- `fix/api-timeout`
- `docs/update-readme`
- `refactor/workflow-builder`
- `test/dataflow-integration`

### 4. PR Description

Pull requests MUST include:

- Summary of changes (what and why)
- Test plan (how to verify)
- Related issues (links)

**Template**:

```markdown
## Summary

[1-3 bullet points]

## Test plan

- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Related issues

Fixes #123
```

### 5. Atomic Commits

Each commit MUST be self-contained.

**Correct**:

- One commit per logical change
- Tests and implementation together
- Each commit builds and passes tests

**Incorrect**:

```
❌ "WIP"
❌ "fix stuff"
❌ "update files"
❌ Multiple unrelated changes
```

## MUST NOT Rules

### 1. No Direct Push to Main

MUST NOT push directly to main/master branch. All changes go through PRs.

**Enforced by**: GitHub branch protection (active on all 4 repos)
**Consequence**: Push rejected by GitHub
**Workflow**: See `rules/branch-protection.md` for the PR workflow
**Admin bypass**: Owner can merge with `gh pr merge <N> --admin --merge --delete-branch`

### 2. No Force Push to Main

MUST NOT force push to main/master.

**Enforced by**: Branch protection
**Consequence**: Team notification, potential rollback

### 3. No Secrets in Commits

MUST NOT commit secrets, even in history.

**Detection**: Pre-commit secret scanning
**Consequence**: History rewrite required

**Check for**:

- API keys
- Passwords
- Tokens
- Private keys
- .env files

### 4. No Large Binaries

MUST NOT commit large binary files.

**Limits**:

- Single file: <10MB
- Total repo: <1GB

**Alternatives**:

- Git LFS for large files
- External storage for assets

## Pre-Commit Checklist

Before every commit:

- [ ] Code review completed (intermediate-reviewer)
- [ ] Security review completed (security-reviewer)
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] No secrets in changes
- [ ] Commit message follows convention

## Branching Strategy

### Main

- Always deployable
- Protected branch
- Requires PR with reviews

### Feature Branches

- Branch from main
- PR back to main
- Delete after merge

### Hotfix Branches

- Branch from main
- Fix critical issues
- Fast-track review process

## Exceptions

Git exceptions require:

1. Explicit user approval
2. Documentation in PR
3. Team notification for force operations
