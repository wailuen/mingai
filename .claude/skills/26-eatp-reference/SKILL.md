# EATP Framework Reference

This skill provides the technical reference for the Enterprise Agent Trust Protocol (EATP) - the trust verification protocol for enterprise AI agents.

## Knowledge Sources

This skill is self-contained — all essential EATP knowledge is distilled below from the EATP Core Thesis by Dr. Jack Hong and the EATP specification. If Foundation source docs exist in this repo, read them for additional depth.

## What is EATP?

EATP is an open standard for establishing and verifying trust in enterprise AI agent systems. It separates trust establishment (human judgment, once) from trust verification (machine speed, continuously). Every action traces back to human decisions through verifiable cryptographic chains.

EATP operationalizes the CARE framework's governance philosophy as a concrete, implementable protocol.

## The Core Insight

The problem conflates two distinct moments:

- **Trust establishment**: Should this agent be permitted to act within these boundaries? (Human judgment)
- **Trust verification**: Does this action fall within those boundaries? (Machine verification, milliseconds)

Traditional governance performs both together. EATP separates them.

## The Five EATP Elements (Trust Lineage Chain)

### 1. Genesis Record

The organizational root of trust. A human executive cryptographically commits: "I accept accountability for this AI governance framework." No AI creates its own genesis record.

### 2. Delegation Record

Authority transfer with constraint tightening. **Delegations can only reduce authority, never expand it.** A manager with $50K authority can delegate $10K to an agent, not $75K. Mirrors how healthy organizations work.

### 3. Constraint Envelope

Multi-dimensional operating boundaries across five dimensions:

| Dimension         | Examples                                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Financial**     | Transaction limits, spending caps, cumulative budgets     |
| **Operational**   | Permitted/blocked actions                                 |
| **Temporal**      | Operating hours, blackout periods, time-bounded auth      |
| **Data Access**   | Read/write permissions, PII handling, data classification |
| **Communication** | Permitted channels, approved recipients, tone guidelines  |

### 4. Capability Attestation

Signed declaration of authorized capabilities. Prevents capability drift (agents gradually performing unauthorized tasks). Makes authorized scope explicit and verifiable.

### 5. Audit Anchor

Tamper-evident execution record. Each anchor hashes the previous; modifying any record invalidates the chain forward. Production should use Merkle trees or external checkpointing.

## Verification Gradient

Verification is not binary:

| Result            | Meaning                  | Action                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Auto-approved** | Within all constraints   | Execute and log                  |
| **Flagged**       | Near constraint boundary | Execute and highlight for review |
| **Held**          | Soft limit exceeded      | Queue for human approval         |
| **Blocked**       | Hard limit violated      | Reject with explanation          |

Focuses human attention where it matters: near boundaries and at limits.

## Five Trust Postures

Graduated autonomy:

| Posture                | Autonomy | Human Role                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pseudo-Agent**       | None     | Human in-the-loop; agent is interface only        |
| **Supervised**         | Low      | Human in-the-loop; agent proposes, human approves |
| **Shared Planning**    | Medium   | Human on-the-loop; co-planning                    |
| **Continuous Insight** | High     | Human on-the-loop; agent executes, human monitors |
| **Delegated**          | Full     | Human on-the-loop; remote monitoring              |

Postures upgrade through demonstrated performance. They downgrade instantly if conditions change.

## EATP Operations

- **ESTABLISH** - Create agent identity and initial trust
- **DELEGATE** - Transfer authority with constraints
- **VERIFY** - Validate trust chain and permissions
- **AUDIT** - Record and trace all trust operations

## The Traceability Distinction (Critical)

**EATP provides traceability, not accountability.**

- **Traceability**: Trace any AI action back to human authority. EATP delivers this.
- **Accountability**: Humans understand, evaluate, and bear consequences. No protocol can deliver this.
- Traceability is necessary for accountability but not sufficient.

## How EATP Differs from Existing Standards

| Standard         | Handles               | EATP Adds                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **OAuth/OIDC**   | User authentication   | Agent trust delegation              |
| **SPIFFE/SPIRE** | Service identity      | Agent autonomy governance           |
| **Zero-Trust**   | Network security      | Agent governance with trust lineage |
| **PKI**          | Hierarchical identity | Action-to-human traceability        |

Existing standards verify identity and access. EATP verifies that actions are within human-established trust boundaries with unbroken chains to human authority.

## Cascade Revocation

Trust revocation at any level automatically revokes all downstream delegations. No orphaned agents. Mitigations for propagation latency: short-lived credentials (5-minute validity), push-based revocation, action idempotency.
