## Workspace Resolution

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a project name, use 
2. Otherwise, use the most recently modified directory under  (excluding `instructions/`)
3. If no workspace exists, ask the user to create one first
4. Read all files in  for user context (this is the user's input surface)

## Phase Check

- Read  to confirm validation passed
- Read `docs/` and `docs/00-authority/` for knowledge base
- Output: update existing agents and skills in their canonical locations (e.g., `agents/frameworks/`, `skills/01-core-sdk/`, `skills/02-dataflow/`, etc.)

## Workflow

### 1. Deep knowledge extraction

Using as many subagents as required, peruse `docs/`, especially `docs/00-authority/`.

- Ultrathink and read beyond the docs into the intent of this project/product
- Understand the roles and use of agents, skills, docs:
  - **Agents** — What to do, how to think about this, what can it work with, following procedural directives
  - **Skills** — Distilled knowledge that agents can achieve 100% situational awareness with
  - **`docs/`** — Full knowledge base

### 2. Update existing agents

Improve agents in their canonical locations (e.g., `agents/frameworks/`, `agents/standards/`, etc.).

- Reference `.claude/agents/_subagent-guide.md` for agent format
- Identify which existing agent(s) should absorb the new knowledge
- Add new skills references, update capabilities, refine instructions
- If no existing agent covers the domain, create a new agent in the appropriate canonical directory (e.g., `agents/frameworks/`, `agents/standards/`, `agents/management/`)

### 3. Update existing skills

Improve skills in their canonical locations (e.g., `skills/01-core-sdk/`, `skills/02-dataflow/`, etc.).

- Reference `.claude/guides/claude-code/06-the-skill-system.md` for skill format
- Identify which existing skill directory should absorb the new knowledge
- Add new skill files to the appropriate numbered directory
- Update the directory's `SKILL.md` entry point to reference new files
- Skills must be as detailed as possible so agents can deliver most of their work just by using them
- Should REFERENCE instead of repeating the knowledge base in `docs/`

### 4. Update README.md and documentation (MANDATORY)

After updating agents and skills, ensure user-facing documentation reflects the new capabilities:

1. **README.md** — Verify "Why Kailash?" section includes all new capabilities. Update version numbers in architecture diagram. Ensure no feature claims exceed actual implementation.
2. **Docstrings** — Verify all modified source files have accurate docstrings (no stale claims from pre-implementation state). Run `grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|STUB" src/` to catch stragglers.
3. **Sphinx docs build** — Run `cd docs && python build_docs.py` locally to verify the docs build succeeds and new modules appear in the API reference. The CI workflow (`docs-deploy.yml`) auto-deploys on push to main, but a local build catches errors before push.

**This step was missed in the v0.13.0 release and caught post-release. Never skip it.**

### 5. Red team the agents and skills

Validate that generated agents and skills are correct, complete, and secure.

## Agent Teams

Deploy these agents as a team for codification:

**Knowledge extraction team:**

- **deep-analyst** — Identify core patterns, architectural decisions, and domain knowledge worth capturing
- **requirements-analyst** — Distill requirements into reusable agent instructions
- **coc-expert** — Ensure agents and skills follow COC five-layer architecture (codification IS Layer 5 evolution)

**Creation team:**

- **documentation-validator** — Validate that skill examples are correct and runnable
- **intermediate-reviewer** — Review agent/skill quality before finalizing

**Validation team (red team the agents and skills):**

- **gold-standards-validator** — Ensure agents follow the subagent guide and skills follow the skill system guide
- **testing-specialist** — Verify any code examples in skills are testable
- **security-reviewer** — Audit generated agents/skills for prompt injection vectors, insecure patterns, or secrets exposure (codified artifacts persist across all future sessions)

**COC template sync (after codification completes):**

- **coc-sync** — Transform and sync all agents, skills, rules, and commands to the COC template repository (`kailash-coc-claude-py`), stripping builder-specific content. Only runs if the repo exists at `kailash-coc-claude-py/`. See `.claude/skills/management/coc-sync-mapping.md` for transform rules.
