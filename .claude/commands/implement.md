## Workspace Resolution

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a project name or todo, parse accordingly
2. Otherwise, use the most recently modified directory under  (excluding `instructions/`)
3. If no workspace exists, ask the user to create one first
4. Read all files in  for user context (this is the user's input surface)

## Phase Check

- Read files in  to see what needs doing
- Read files in  to see what's done
- If `$ARGUMENTS` specifies a specific todo, focus on that one
- Otherwise, pick the next active todo
- Reference plans in  for context

## Workflow

### NOTE: Run `/implement` repeatedly until all todos/active have been moved to todos/completed

### 1. Prepare todos

You MUST always use the todo-manager to create detailed todos for EVERY SINGLE TODO in `todos/000-master.md`.

- Review with agents before implementation
- Ensure that both FE and BE detailed todos exist, if applicable

### 2. Implement

Continue with the implementation of the next todo/phase using a team of agents, following procedural directives.

- Ensure that both FE and BE are implemented, if applicable

### 3. Quality standards

Always involve tdd-implementer, testing-specialists, value auditor, ai ui ux specialists, with any agents relevant to the work at hand.

- Test for rigor, completeness, and quality of output from both value and technical user perspectives
- Pre-existing failures often hint that you are missing something obvious and critical
  - Always address pre-existing failures — do not pass until all failures, warnings, hints are resolved
- Always identify the root causes of issues, and implement optimal, elegant fixes

### 4. Testing requirements

**Test-once protocol**: Tests run ONCE per code change, not once per phase.

**Before implementing (baseline):**

1. Run the full test suite ONCE to establish baseline: `pytest tests/ -x --tb=short -q`
2. Record the result: pass count, fail count, commit hash
3. If there are pre-existing failures, note them — they are NOT your regressions

**During implementation (TDD cycle):**

- tdd-implementer runs tests as part of red-green-refactor — this is the ONE authoritative test run
- Run only affected tests during development for speed: `pytest tests/unit/path_to_affected/ -x`
- Run the full suite ONCE when the todo is complete (not after every small change)

**After implementing (regression check):**

1. Run full suite: `pytest tests/ -x --tb=short -q`
2. Compare against baseline: if any test that passed before now fails, you introduced a regression — STOP and fix
3. Write `.test-results` artifact in workspace: 

**`.test-results` format:**

```
commit: <git hash>
timestamp: <ISO 8601>
baseline_pass: <N>
baseline_fail: <N>
final_pass: <N>
final_fail: <N>
new_tests: <N>
regressions: <N> (must be 0)
command: pytest tests/ -x --tb=short -q
```

**Bug fixes MUST include regression tests:**

- Every bug fix adds a test to `tests/regression/` marked with `@pytest.mark.regression`
- The test MUST reproduce the bug (fail before fix, pass after)
- Regression tests are NEVER deleted — they are permanent guards

**What NOT to do:**

- Do NOT run the full suite multiple times per todo
- Do NOT let testing-specialist re-run tests that tdd-implementer already ran
- Do NOT re-run tests just to "verify" — read the results from the last run

### 5. LLM usage

When writing and testing agents, always utilize the LLM's capabilities instead of naive NLP approaches (keywords, regex, etc).

- Use ollama or openai (if ollama is too slow)
- Always check `.env` for api keys and model names to use in development
  - Always assume model names in memory are outdated — perform a web check on model names in `.env` before declaring them invalid

### 6. Update docs and close todos

After completing each todo:

- Move it from `todos/active/` to `todos/completed/`
- Ensure every task is verified with evidence before closing

At the end of each implementation cycle, create and update documentation at the **project root** (not inside the workspace):

- `docs/` (complete detailed docs capturing every detail of the codebase)
  - This is the last resort document that agents use to find elusive and deep documentation
- `docs/00-authority/`
  - Authoritative documents that developers and codegen read first for full situational awareness
  - Ensure you create/update `README.md` (navigating authority documents) and `CLAUDE.md` (preloaded instructions)
- Use as many subdirectories and files as required, naming them sequentially 00-, 01- for easy referencing
- Focus on capturing the essence and intent — the 'what it is' and 'how to use it' — not status/progress/reports

## Agent Teams

Deploy these agents as a team for each implementation cycle:

**Core team (always):**

- **tdd-implementer** — Test-first development, red-green-refactor
- **testing-specialist** — 3-tier test strategy, real infrastructure recommended in Tier 2-3
- **intermediate-reviewer** — Code review after every file change (MANDATORY)
- **todo-manager** — Track progress, update todo status, verify completion with evidence

**Specialist (invoke ONE matching the current todo):**

- **pattern-expert** — Workflow patterns, node configuration
- **dataflow-specialist** — Database operations (if project uses DataFlow)
- **nexus-specialist** — API deployment (if project uses Nexus)
- **kaizen-specialist** — AI agents (if project uses Kaizen)
- **mcp-specialist** — MCP integration (if project uses MCP)

**Frontend team (when implementing frontend):**

- **uiux-designer** — Design system, visual hierarchy, responsive layouts
- **react-specialist** or **flutter-specialist** — Framework-specific implementation
- **ai-ux-designer** — AI interaction patterns (if AI-facing UI)
- **frontend-developer** — Responsive UI components

**Recovery (invoke when builds break):**

- **build-fix** — Fix build/type errors with minimal changes (NO architectural changes)

**Quality gate (once per todo, before closing):**

- **value-auditor** — Evaluate from user/buyer perspective, not just technical assertions
- **security-reviewer** — Security audit before any commit (MANDATORY)
